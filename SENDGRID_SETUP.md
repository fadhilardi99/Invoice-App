# SendGrid Integration Setup Guide

## üöÄ Overview

This guide will help you set up SendGrid for real email functionality in your invoice app. SendGrid is a popular email service that provides reliable email delivery and analytics.

## üìã Prerequisites

1. **SendGrid Account**: Sign up at [sendgrid.com](https://sendgrid.com)
2. **Domain Verification**: You'll need to verify your domain with SendGrid
3. **API Key**: Generate an API key from your SendGrid dashboard

## üîß Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Create SendGrid Account

1. Go to [sendgrid.com](https://sendgrid.com)
2. Click "Start for Free" or "Sign Up"
3. Complete the registration process
4. Verify your email address

### 2. Verify Your Domain

1. **Login to SendGrid Dashboard**
2. **Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Sender Authentication**
3. **Click "Authenticate Your Domain"**
4. **Enter your domain** (e.g., `yourdomain.com`)
5. **Add DNS records** as instructed:
   - CNAME records for authentication
   - SPF record for email authentication
   - DKIM record for email signing

### 3. Create API Key

1. **Go to Settings ‚Üí API Keys**
2. **Click "Create API Key"**
3. **Choose "Full Access"** (or "Restricted Access" with Mail Send permissions)
4. **Name your key** (e.g., "Invoice App API Key")
5. **Copy the API key** (you won't see it again!)

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@db.[YOUR-PROJECT-REF].supabase.co:5432/postgres"

# SendGrid Configuration
SENDGRID_API_KEY="SG.your_actual_api_key_here"
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL="noreply@yourdomain.com"
SENDGRID_FROM_NAME="PT. Elektronik Indonesia"

# Next.js
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-nextauth-secret"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

### 5. Update Sender Email

Replace `noreply@yourdomain.com` with your verified domain email.

## üß™ Testing the Integration

### Development Mode (No SendGrid Key)

If you don't have a SendGrid API key configured, the app will run in simulation mode:

```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

The email functionality will work with simulated sending and show appropriate messages.

### Production Mode (With SendGrid Key)

1. **Add your SendGrid API key** to `.env.local`
2. **Restart the development server**
3. **Test email sending** from the invoice detail page

## üìß Email Features

### HTML Email Template

The app includes a professional HTML email template with:

- **Company branding** with gradient header
- **Invoice details** in a clean table format
- **Payment information** with bank details
- **Professional styling** with responsive design
- **Plain text fallback** for email clients that don't support HTML

### Email Content

Each email includes:

- **Invoice number** and date
- **Client information** (name, email)
- **Itemized list** with quantities and prices
- **Total amount** in Indonesian Rupiah
- **Payment instructions** with bank details
- **Due date** information
- **Company contact** information

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

```

```

**Solution**: Check your `SENDGRID_API_KEY` environment variable

#### 2. "Forbidden" Error

```

**Solution**:

- Ensure your account is active

#### 3. Email Not Delivered

**Solutions**:
